## Debugging
See https://docs.obsidian.md/Themes/App+themes/Build+a+theme

- Obsidian sync dir: /Users/USERNAME/Obsidian/Main/Main/.obsidian
  - Directly open and edit the `theme.css` file
  - As you save, Obsidian Sync will update the theme live - view on both the desktop app and on mobile.
- To enable mobile debugging: open the app, open dev tools, enter `app.emulateMobile(true)`
